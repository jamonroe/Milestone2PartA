Please note that this is first course is different in structure compared to most Udacity CS courses. There is a final project at the end of the course, and there are no programming quizzes throughout this course. This course covers Supervised Learning, a machine learning task that makes it possible for your phone to recognize your voice, your email to filter spam, and for computers to learn a bunch of other cool stuff. Supervised Learning is an important component of all kinds of technologies, from stopping credit card fraud, to finding faces in camera images, to recognizing spoken language. Our goal is to give you the skills that you need to understand these technologies and interpret their output, which is important for solving a range of data science problems. And for surviving a robot uprising. You can expect to spend 4-6 hours per week on this course. Series Information: Machine Learning is a graduate-level series of 3 courses, covering the area of Artificial Intelligence concerned with computer programs that modify and improve their performance through experiences. Machine Learning 1: Supervised Learning (this course) Machine Learning 2: Unsupervised Learning Machine Learning 3: Reinforcement Learning If you are new to Machine Learning, we recommend you take these 3 courses in order. The entire series is taught as a lively and rigorous dialogue between two eminent Machine Learning professors and friends: Professor Charles Isbell (Georgia Tech) and Professor Michael Littman (Brown University). In this course, you will gain an understanding of a variety of topics and methods in Supervised Learning. Like function approximation in general, Supervised Learning prompts you to make generalizations based on fundamental assumptions about the world. Michael: So why wouldn't you call it "function induction?" Charles: Because someone said "supervised learning" first. Topics covered in this course include: Decision trees, neural networks, instance-based learning, ensemble learning, computational learning theory, Bayesian learning, and many other fascinating machine learning concepts. In your final project, you will explore important techniques in Supervised Learning, and apply your knowledge to analyze how algorithms behave under a variety of circumstances. A strong familiarity with Probability Theory, Linear Algebra and Statistics is required. An understanding of Intro to Statistics, especially Lessons 8, 9 and 10, would be helpful. Students should also have some experience in programming (perhaps through Introduction to CS) and a familiarity with Neural Networks (as covered in Introduction to Artificial Learning).

Promoted by John Tukey, EDA focuses on exploring data to understand the data’s underlying structure and variables, to develop intuition about the data set, consider how that data set came into existence, and decide how it can be investigated with more formal statistical methods. If you're interested in supplemental reading material for the course check out the Exploratory Data Analysis book. (Not Required) You will... Understand EDA as a journey and a way to explore data Explore data at multiple levels using appropriate visualizations Acquire statistical knowledge for summarizing data Demonstrate curiosity and skepticism when performing EDA Develop intuition around a data set and understand how the data was generated. A background in statistics is helpful but not required. Consider taking Statistics: The Science of Decisions prior to taking this course. Relavant topics include: Mean, median, mode Normal, uniform, and skewed distributions Histograms and box plots Familiarity with the following CS and Math topics will help students: Variable assignment Comparison and logical operators ( <, >, <=, >=, ==, &, | ) If else statements Square roots, logarithms, and exponentials Jump into a new dataset. Explore, create plots, and summarize the fascinating things you find. Lesson 1: What is EDA? (1 hour) We'll start by learn about what exploratory data analysis (EDA) is and why it is important. You'll meet the amazing instructors for the course and find out about the course structure and final project. Lesson 2: R Basics (3 hours) EDA, which comes before formal hypothesis testing and modeling, makes use of visual methods to analyze and summarize data sets. R will be our tool for generating those visuals and conducting analyses. In this lesson, we will install RStudio and packages, learn the layout and basic commands of R, practice writing basic R scripts, and inspect data sets. Lesson 3: Explore One Variable (4 hours) We perform EDA to understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers. Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set as we begin to make sense of a pseudo-data set of Facebook users. While the data set does not contain real user data, it does contain a wealth of information. Through the lesson, we will create histograms and boxplots, transform variables, and examine tradeoffs in visualizations. Problem Set 3 (2 hours) Lesson 4: Explore Two Variables (4 hours) EDA allows us to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models. In this lesson, we will learn techniques for exploring the relationship between any two variables in a data set. We'll create scatter plots, calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means. Problem Set 4 (2 hours) Lesson 5: Explore Many Variables (4 hours) Data sets can be complex. In this lesson, we will learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables. We'll learn how to reshape data frames and how to use aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information. Extending our knowledge of previous plots, we'll continue to build intuition around the Facebook data set and explore some new data sets as well. Problem Set 5 (2 hours) Lesson 6: Diamonds and Price Predictions (2 hours) Investigate the diamonds data set alongside Facebook Data Scientist, Solomon Messing. He'll recap many of the strategies covered in the course and show how predictive modeling can allow us to determine a good price for a diamond.

By the end of this short course, you'll use the skills you've developed to conceptualize and create your own app. To get you there, your instructors Samantha and Andy will first help you build an app that could be used to manage logistics at a music festival. Though this is a very specific app use case, the skills you learn will be applicable to just about any business app you’d want to develop. After completing this course you will have built your own web and mobile app. You will become familiar with the concept of abstraction and how to think about concrete problems in their most general sense -- a concept critical for all developers. In addition, you will learn how to map out a data model, create data visualizations, and automate manual processes after analyzing your abstractions. What kind of apps can you build? Well, Facebook uses a Salesforce app to manage their entire hire-to-retire process: collecting resumes, sharing feedback, making job offers, and developing talent. And the Obama 2012 campaign built apps to mobilize their vast volunteer network and visualize the pulse of the nation in real-time. What will you build? Good news! You don't need any programming experience and you don't need to know anything about Salesforce. You'll learn the ins and outs of point-and-click development, so all you need now is an interest in building an app. One thing you should know: the skills you learn in this course are in high demand and will help further your career. Design and build your own mobile-friendly Salesforce app. Overview In this class you’ll learn the basics of building apps with Force.com, a part of Salesforce Platform. These apps are typically business apps: they solve organizational and logistical problems. You probably wouldn’t use Salesforce to build a computer game (though you could!). There are two ways to build apps in Force.com: with or without code. This class will only cover the non-coding, point-and-click app building interface. But don’t be fooled! Building powerful apps does not require writing code. This class contains an introductory lesson, five primary lessons where you'll be building and learning (each of which has an accompanying problem set to practice your skills), and a final project where you'll put everything together. Lesson 0: What is Salesforce (15 mins) What is Salesforce Platform? What does it do? Why should I learn about it? What kind of jobs can I get after I learn how to use it? In this lesson, you’ll meet the instructors, get to know the class, and learn a bit about Salesforce in general. Lesson 1: Creating your First App (90 minutes) In this lesson you’ll get acquainted with Force.com and actually build the beginnings of your first app. You’ll get some experience taking a big problem (in this case, managing a music festival), breaking it into smaller parts, and representing those parts in Salesforce. As you do this, you’ll learn about the basic components of a Salesforce app and add some simple (but powerful) functionality to your app. More concretely, you’ll learn about: Salesforce Data: Salesforce represents data as objects, fields, and records. You’ll learn what these terms mean and build them into your app. Relationships: When the pieces of your app start communicating, interesting things can happen. In this lesson you’ll learn the basics of Salesforce relationship fields. Validation Rules: If you’ve ever incorrectly entered your credit card number into a website, you already know about validation rules. In this lesson, you’ll learn how to build them into your app. Formulas and Summaries: These tools let you easily keep track of quantifiable things like money spent, customers contacted, or tickets sold. In this lesson you’ll learn how to build these automated calculations into your app. Lesson 2: Building out your Data Model (90 mins) Behind every powerful business app is a well-planned data model (also known as a schema). In this lesson you’ll learn how to decompose a complex problem into its component pieces and then connect those pieces together with the appropriate relationship fields. The data model you build will serve as the schematic skeleton onto which you’ll build dynamic functionality in later lessons. The specific topics covered are: One-to-Many Relationships: These relationships let the pieces of your app talk to each other. In this lesson you’ll learn how and when (and why) to use master-detail and lookup relationships in the apps you build. Many-to-Many Relationships: You’ll learn how to use a junction object to add flexibility into your data model. Customizing the User Interface: Good apps should be easy to use! In this lesson you’ll learn how to configure the layout of your app to make sure the UI is simple and intuitive. Schema Builder: There are many ways to get things done in Salesforce. In this lesson you’ll start using the schema builder to understand how your app works. Data Loading: This is a convenient way to get lots of data onto your app at once. Lesson 3: Visualizing your Data (45 mins) No matter what kind of app you’re building, you’ve probably got some data that you want other people in your organization to understand quickly and easily. In this lesson you’ll learn how quickly communicate information with real-time data visualizations. Specifically, you’ll learn how to make: Reports: These let you gather related information into one place. These let you gather data according to specific criteria and display it in neat rows and columns. Charts: These let you graphically summarize the information in a report. Dashboards: Different people want access to different information. A dashboard is a collection of charts that give specific people in your organization exactly the information that they need in real-time. Views: Data is good, but sometimes you have too much. Views let you selectively and quickly display only the data you care about. Lesson 4: Adding Automation (45 mins) In this lesson you’ll think about how to use your app to automate manual tasks. You’ll learn how to use two important Salesforce tools: Workflows: There are situations where a series of steps need to happen in sequence: first do this, then do that. Workflows let you automate processes like these, such as sending an email, assigning a task, or updating a field. Approval Processes: You don’t want every job to be completely automated. Sometimes you need someone to step in and say “this looks good.” Approval processes add a human element to your automated tasks. Lesson 5: Make it Social. Make it Mobile. (45 mins) This is it. With a few clicks of the mouse you’ll make your app social and mobile. The tools you’ll use are: Chatter: This will let your users collaborate on the projects and records they work on together. Salesforce1: That web app you’ve been building this whole time? It’s actually a mobile app too. You’ll even learn how to quickly customize your mobile interface and add functionality for mobile productivity. Final Project: Build your own App (2-4 hours) By the time you get here, you will have already built a music festival management app. Now it’s time to take your own idea and turn it into a functional web and mobile app.</td><td>http://www.udacity.com/course/ud162</td><td>//lh5.ggpht.com/kI0ik4ILo3V22AmxDwyaAYaTFH__6PXBFyIYqmmNei3qhTGJIyT-jLLmpooYEqMyM8BehSTQEGmlnvIJWrs7=s0#w=1757&h=1080</td></tr><tr height="10px"><td>How To Build A Startup: The Lean Launchpad</td><td>null</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>Steve Blank, Kathleen Mullaney</td><td>Learn the key tools and steps to build a successful startup (or at least reduce the risk of failure).

This course is designed to teach web developers what they need to know to create great cross-device mobile web experiences. This course will focus on building mobile web apps, which will work across multiple platforms including Android, iOS, and others. After completing this class, you’ll have built a web application with a first-class mobile experience. You’ll understand what it takes to build great web experiences on mobile devices, have gained experience with the tools you need to test performance, and be able to apply your knowledge to your own projects in the future. This course is for experienced front-end web developers who’d like to learn what it takes to create great mobile experiences. In order to succeed in this class, you should be comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and should have experience creating web apps, either professionally or for fun. You don't need to know any specific HTML5 extras or APIs, we'll cover any of those that we need as the course progresses. Design and build a mobile app that takes advantage of touch screen functionality. In this course, you will learn how to build web experiences that adapt to the different screen sizes and capabilities that mobile devices offer, and how to scalably optimize media for mobile and desktop. We will cover programming touch interaction, as well as how to optimize form field input for mobile devices and use APIs like geolocation and the accelerometer, and ensuring your web experiences work great when network conditions are sub-optimal. Finally, you’ll gain the tools to investigate performance in mobile applications, with a strong understanding of mobile networking, battery usage patterns and optimizing paint techniques to build smooth animations on mobile. Lesson 01: Syllabus We’ll start with a high-level overview of the course and what to expect in it. We’ll also go into more depth on what we mean by mobile web development, and why you should care about it. Lesson 02: Mobile Development Tools Workflow and tooling is incredibly important for building great web apps, and this carries over to mobile web development. This lesson will show you how to use the Chrome Developer Tools to develop for the mobile web. Lesson 03: Mobile UX and Viewport Designing for the mobile web is all about a smooth user experience. This lesson will get you thinking about how to achieve that on mobile, and we’ll introduce the first of many tools you need to achieve this: the viewport. Lesson 04: Fluid Design Mobile means lots of different devices and form factors. We’ll discuss how to make your site responsive, clean, and user-friendly on multiple devices and layouts. Lesson 05: Media Queries Sometimes different devices call for fundamentally different layouts. This lesson will teach you how to achieve this using media queries. Lesson 06: Responsive Images Media requirements are different in mobile - network constraints and very high resolution screens set up a conflict that can be challenging. We’ll talk about how best to integrate media into your mobile web applications, and adaptively scaling images based on the environment. Lesson 07: Optimizing Performance Users expect a fast, seamless experience on mobile. We’ll go over optimizing various performance metrics to improve that experience, such as network, cpu, rendering, and battery performance. Lesson 08: Touch Touch input is fundamentally different from mouse input, and requires you to think about your user interactions differently. We’ll go over UX concerns with touch-based interaction, and how to design user interactions that work across devices. Lesson 09: Input Using a keyboard on mobile is awful. We’ll discuss ways to improve it, using semantic input for form data, and other user input options on mobile. Lesson 10: Device Access Mobile devices have a full array of sensors typically unavailable on desktop. We’ll talk about camera access, geolocation, and other sensors and feedback you have access to on mobile. Lesson 11: Offline and Storage It’s an unfortunate reality that mobile users aren’t always online. We’ll go over using the local cache as well as local storage APIs to give your users a great offline (and partially-online) experience as well. Lesson 12: Wrap-up We’ll finish up the class by talking briefly about other topics to consider, such as app experience, monetization, deployment and distribution. We’ll also point you to other resources to look at moving forward in your career.</td><td>http://www.udacity.com/course/cs256</td><td>//lh5.ggpht.com/IKdCmTWn8a2nMhlwMYzryvzRN5CUZAOBr4tDrEAbszV7TIFe9pRAInA4kkYcgTXwrifJsBEsq1agTueuu-g=s0#w=436&h=268</td></tr><tr height="10px"><td>Learn HTML5 -  Game Development Course Online</td><td>null</td><td>2</td><td>Google</td><td>Colt McAnlis, Peter Lubbers, Sean Bennett</td><td>This course will walk you through the major components of building GRITS, an HTML5 game.

We will use some basic object-oriented concepts to model robot motion and perception. If you don’t know Python but have experience with another language, you should be able to pick up the syntax fairly quickly. If you have no programming experience, you should consider taking Udacity’s Introduction to Computer Science course before attempting this one. The math used will be centered on probability and linear algebra. You don’t need to be an expert in either, but some familiarity with concepts in probability (e.g. probabilities must add to one, conditional probability, and Bayes’ rule) will be extremely helpful. It is possible to learn these concepts during the course, but it will take more work. Knowledge of linear algebra, while helpful, is not required.

With this wisdom in mind (and a desire to, you know, teach programming) we made this class. Ten minutes into this class you will have your own completely personalized version of the insanely addictive game 2048. Even if you've never coded before. Pretty cool, no? The purpose of this class is to have fun learning how to quickly and easily take an existing open source program, make some changes, and create something that looks and feels completely new. The game you create will be mobile friendly (you can play it on your phone!) and totally shareable. You'll also learn things! If you're a new / beginning programmer, you'll learn: How a "real" program works, at least from a big picture point of view. What HTML, CSS, and Javascript are and how they interact to make a functioning web application. How to make small changes to HTML and CSS files that have very large changes in a program (large enough to turn the original 2048 game into a drastically different Udacity version). How to use Github to make a copy of an open-source program, make changes to that copy, create your own version, and then host that version so you can share it with your friends. Why open-source is such an amazing idea :) If you have more programming experience, you will: Quickly explore the 2048 source code. Dive into the Javascript that makes the game run. Make (or learn how to make) a version of the game that actually behaves differently (maybe your version uses a 5x5 grid? Or maybe it has a button to shuffle tiles? Who knows!) Help a lot of new programmers in the discussion forums as they have their first experience with programming, web-development, and the open-source community. Nothing! Really. Nothing. This course is designed to help someone who has never seen computer code take their first steps into the world of programming and web-development. If you do have more programming background, you'll be able to make more advanced changes in your personalized versions of the game, and lesson two should be especially interesting. Lesson 1: Exploring the HTML and CSS This lesson is primarily for students with little to no programming experience. You will create our own version by making changes to the existing HTML and CSS files. Within 10 minutes, you'll have your own game. Within an hour, you'll be able to send a link to your friends to share your creation (fun bonus: your game will be totally mobile-friendly). The topics we'll cover are: What is open source? What is HTML? What is CSS? Javascript? How do these three interact to lead to a fully functioning web/mobile app? What is Github? How do I get someone else's code, make changes, and create my own version? How do I host and share my game? Lesson 2: Diving into the Javascript (coming soon) This lesson is meant for more experienced programmers as well as enthusiastic students who finish lesson one and can't wait for more. We will add an "undo" button to our game, but really we'll be learning how to understand a relatively large Javascript codebase and strategically make small changes to modify the core functionality of the game. The topics we'll cover: A very rapid intro to Javascript. (note: this part will be tough, but not impossible, if you are completely new to programming). How to efficiently understand a large codebase.
